# Hotsheet

**Manage your Rails database through a spreadsheet-like interface.**

- Look at and modify your DB within the app itself (no rails console required!).
- Give controlled DB access to your admin users without having to create CRUD views for each table.
- Lightweight and fast. We keep usage simple and configuration to the minimum.

## Installation

1. Add `gem "hotsheet"` to your Gemfile.
1. Run `bundle`.
1. Run `bin/rails g hotsheet:install`.

## Usage

After the installation, you can start the Rails server and visit
[/hotsheet](http://localhost:3000/hotsheet) to view the spreadsheet.

### Configuration

You can configure which models ('sheets') this gem should manage, and specify which
database columns should be editable or viewable in the spreadsheet. This can be
done by editing the [config/initializers/hotsheet.rb](https://github.com/renuo/hotsheet/blob/main/lib/generators/templates/hotsheet.rb)
file created by the install command:

```rb
Hotsheet.configure do
  # Configure the visible and editable columns for each model.
  # The ID is included as the first column by default.
  # The number of rows displayed can be configured using the `per` option,
  # which defaults to 100.

  sheet :User, per: 10 do
    column :name
    column :email, editable: false
    column :birthdate, editable: -> { rand > 0.5 }
  end

  # Leave the block out to include all database columns.
  sheet :Post
end
```

### Basic Authentication

If you don't want everyone to have access to Hotsheet, you can set a
basic auth environment variable:

```sh
HOTSHEET_BASIC_AUTH="admin:password"
```

### Internationalization

You can create custom translations by overwriting the default locales defined in
[config/locales/en.yml](https://github.com/renuo/hotsheet/blob/main/config/locales/en.yml).

## Roadmap

This is a newly created gem, and we will firstly focus on:

1. Single-user experience (styles and usability)
1. Configuration and access permissions
1. Concurrent users (broadcasting, conflict resolution)

or add your own.
