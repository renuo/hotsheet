# Hotsheet

### Manage your database with a simple and familiar web interface

This gem allows you to mount a view to manage your database using a table view where you can edit DB records inline.

## Installation

Add and install the gem by adding this to the application's Gemfile:

```rb
gem "hotsheet"
```

And executing:

```sh
bundle
bin/rails g hotsheet:install
```

## Usage



You can also configure which models the gem should manage, and even specify columns within them, by configuring the initializer file created by the install command:

```rb
# config/initializers/hotsheet.rb

Hotsheet.configure do |config|
  config.model :Author do |model|
    model.included_attributes = %i[name birthdate gender] # mutually exclusive with "excluded_attributes"
    # model.excluded_attributes = %i[created_at updated_at] # mutually exclusive with "included_attributes"
  end
end

```

Finally, you will need to create a configuration file to specify which models you want to manage with Hotsheet.

## Development: Local Setup

After cloning the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.

- Run tests: `bin/check`
- Run linters: `bin/fastcheck`
- Start dummy app: `spec/dummy/bin/run`

## TODO

- Fetch all models in the application by default
- Support live updates (show when someone has the intention to edit a resource) via ActionCable
- Conflict resolution strategy (locking / merging / latest change etc.)
- Fine grained access / permissions (cancancan)
- Type specific input fields
- Undo feature (or confirm / discard changes icons)
- Configure visibility of non-editable (excluded) fields
- Use importmap-rails for js dependencies
